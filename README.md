# Computational-Engineering-Physics
All the code I have written regarding computing and Engineering Physics applcations. Further, using numerical methods to solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems utilizing Python. Topics include numerical differentiation and integration, root finding and optimization problems, linear systems of equations, finite-element modelling, Fourier and other transforms and Monte Carlo simulations.
