Assume that the first magnet sits with its base in the $x-y$ plane and is centred on the z-axis, which is what we have calculated above.  Then, assume that a second, identical cylindrical magnet is placed directly above the first so that the bottom face of the top magnet is a \n",

    "You will be able to use the code and functions above in the Jupyter Notebook (from 6.1 and 6.2), which will allow you to calculate the magnetic field produced by the bottom magnet at each location on the surface of the top magnet. On the surface (the outer round surface where the surface current is) of the top magnet, it is easy to show that $x = R\\cos(\\phi)$ and $y=R\\sin(\\phi)$, so the magnetic field is evaluated at $(R\\cos(\\phi), R\\sin(\\phi), z)$, where $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq 2\\pi$ and $D+d \\leq z \\leq 2D+d$. To evaluate this new integral, you can create the arrays using the techniques implemented above for the $\\phi$ and $z$ variables.  However, you may want to use a nested for loop to calculate each point by first calculating $\\vec B$ and then using that to calculate the contributing element to the force."
